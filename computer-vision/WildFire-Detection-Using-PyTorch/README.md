# WildFire Detection using PyTorch Computer Vision

## Introduction

The "Wildfire Detection using Computer Vision" project addresses the urgent need for early wildfire detection. Utilizing advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques, our team developed a model capable of identifying wildfire incidents from a curated dataset of images. This technology aims to enhance current detection methods, providing a faster, more efficient response to wildfires.

## Methodology

We employed the PyTorch framework to build and train our machine learning model. The process involved careful selection and preparation of a diverse dataset, categorizing images into 'fire' and 'no-fire' classes. Our model architecture, based on ResNet50, was optimized using Adam Optimizer and LR Scheduler, ensuring robust learning from the image data.

## Experiments and Results

Our experimental setup focused on training the model to accurately classify images. We implemented various image transformations, such as resizing and rotation, to enrich the training process. The model demonstrated 68.29% accuracy in distinguishing between fire and no-fire images, showing promise as a reliable tool for early wildfire detection.

## Conclusion

The project's findings underscore the potential of using computer vision for early wildfire detection. While our model achieved notable accuracy, future work will explore integrating more diverse data and refining the model for broader application in real-world scenarios.
